GAME BRAINSTORM  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***
	add ideas; none are set in stone
***

- Game takes place in a hospital where a zombie outbreak has occurred (maybe by some noxious gas in the air system).
- Player must escape hospital and avoid or fight zombies
- 2.5D (pokemon/rpg-style) game view

Possible features:
- combat system 
	Option 1: If you want to keep the "clay" idea: player has tourniqueted "zombie" arm (arm got bitten off and is infected). 
		They can steal the arms of zombies they've killed and sew them onto their own arm for power ups
	Option 2: Player uses things they find in the hospital (shooty shoots, pointy things, le crowbar, fire extinguisher) to attack 
		zombies. 
		
- enemy system
	- zombie swarms, or specialized zombie bosses, or both? What kind of enemy distribution do we want
	
- Wumpus: wanders around rooms
	- The mega zombie. Idk about backstory but its pretty gnarly
	*- Player may or may not be able to defeat it. We should think of some gameplay mechanic involving the wumpus 
		- maybe the wumpus has some electrical ability the player needs to steal in order to open the hospital exit, but 
			they can only defeat the wumpus after they gain some other ability first
	- Lights: when player is within 1 room of wumpus, lights flicker. If they're in the room w/ wumpus, lights OUT! UR dead
	
- Timer or sanity: Player starts out infected; they have to escape the hospital before they turn into a zombie
	Option 1: Sanity bar: when it hits 0, player becomes a zombie. Player is more powerful when they are less sane (bc 
		zombies > humans). They may have to gamble their sanity to get through obstacles
	Option 2: Timer system: player has a watch they can pull up to check time. E.g. they get bitten at 10:00 am, and have 
		two in-game hours (until 12:00 pm) to escape before they become a zombie. 
		Certain game events happen at certain times (eg. at 11:20, the Wumpus appears. At 10:30 zombies from the 	
		pediatrics ward break loose, you know, etc.)
			Suboption (I feel like this would be a hassle): You can save people from getting infected (eg. Dr. Damsel gets 
				bitten by a pediatric-ward zombie at 10:35, but if you barricade the p-ward before 10:30 you can save 
				the good doctor)
- One-way pager: npc kid with a one-way pager
	- A really smart kid got trapped in the security camera room with a one-way pager (ofc) and is sending you messages 
		with useful info (eg. Wumpus location, reconnaissance, door passwords, puzzle info, backstory)
	- Kid makes bad jokes
	- Kid makes game less shooty and more feely
	- You can find the room where the kid is trapped and escort-mission them (piggyback ride?) out of the hospital 
	- You can press 'z' to sit down and unsit, prompting interaction with the kid. (e.g. the kid tells you to sit once for 'Yes'
		and twice for 'no', sit for 5 seconds to have a little chat, etc.)
		
- Feature: item info
	- rpg thing where interacting with items gives you a description of them
		- collect items to solve puzzles? -> need an inventory system. gross.
			- solve puzzles with the help of Pager kid?

tips :p  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/HermanTulleken/20160812/279100/50_Tips_and_Best_Practices_for_Unity_2016_Edition.php (reaadd me)

	-  push and pull requests often to avoid merge conflicts (at least once an hour)
	-  keep the Update method as sparse as possible (it should only call methods; no logic)
	-  Create a prefab for every in-game object you make, in case it accidentally gets deleted. Remember to update the prefab as well
	-  We can't use System.Out.whatever so use Debug.Log("whatever") for debugging. This only works in MonoBehaviours though
	-  Delete the " : Monobehaviour " line from your script unless you actually need it to be a Monobehaviour

	-  Regardless of how many times you use the value, any specific number should be set to a private static readonly (final) variable. This also makes it easier to change the values later.
		-  e.g. private static readonly float PLAYER_SPEED = 4.8f;

	-  Renaming things in your code: don’t just delete the text and retype it. Right-click the method, variable, file, etc. you want to rename and press “rename”—this lets you rename all instances of the name at once.
		-  in Unity, you have to rename C# scripts twice: first, go to Unity right-click the script you want to rename and press “rename” (to rename the file name).
		-  Then, open the script and right-click its name to rename (rename the class’s name). Class and file names have to match.
