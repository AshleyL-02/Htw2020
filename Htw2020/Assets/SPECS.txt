	-  push and pull requests often to avoid merge conflicts (at least once an hour)
	-  keep the Update method as sparse as possible (it should only call methods; no logic)
	-  Create a prefab for every in-game object you make, in case it accidentally gets deleted. Remember to update the prefab as well
	-  We can't use System.Out.whatever so use Debug.Log("whatever") for debugging. This only works in MonoBehaviours though
	-  Delete the " : Monobehaviour " line from your script unless you actually need it to be a Monobehaviour

	-  Regardless of how many times you use the value, any specific number should be set to a private static readonly (final) variable. This also makes it easier to change the values later.
		-  e.g. private static readonly float PLAYER_SPEED = 4.8f;

	-  Renaming things in your code: don’t just delete the text and retype it. Right-click the method, variable, file, etc. you want to rename and press “rename”—this lets you rename all instances of the name at once.
		-  in Unity, you have to rename C# scripts twice: first, go to Unity right-click the script you want to rename and press “rename” (to rename the file name).
		-  Then, open the script and right-click its name to rename (rename the class’s name). Class and file names have to match.
