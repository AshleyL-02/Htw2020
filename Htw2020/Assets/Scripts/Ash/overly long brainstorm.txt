GAMEPLAY IDEAS -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- elements of combat that are fun: dodging. tactical shots (like headshots)



- if the game involves swarms of zombie, navigation needs to be zoomed-out and more open (like long hallways) -> thus camera needs to be more dynamic?
	- camera can be fixed if fighting is more sparse -> the entire room can fit on one screen because player isn't moving as much

- option: player is half-zombie so they're invincible
	- they don't have health. Any status afflictions are just nuisances (like reduced speed, limping, blurry/obstructed/flashing screen, blackouts, double vision, blood dropping everywhere)
			- They can reduce the status afflictions by using items (painkillers, bandages...) until they turn into a drugged-up mummy
			- they can become a killing machine ooo
	- sanity?
	- interesting dynamic with pager kid, who wants the player to save them (encourages player to be violent) but not turn so violent that the pager kid is in jeopardy
	- if player is invincible, how do you kill zombies? fire? Do you just dismember them until they stop moving? Eat them?
	
- sanity system
	- player may choose to draw out zombies to an area so they can get them all at once
	- does sanity reset itself each time the player removes the arm?
	- Consequences of low sanity:
	- consequence of sanity falling to zero:
		-? no consequence. just a lot of status afflictions
		-? game over because player turns into a zombie
	- sanity regeneration:
		- talking to Pager kid
		- meditating (possibly with pager kid)
		-? naturally regenerates
		- doesn't regenerate, but the loss of sanity can be slowed (like with pills)
- health system:
	-? aforementioned "invincible mc"
	-? health bar
	-? player just says how they're feeling (e.g. not good. super not good. really really bad. 11/10)

- type of infection the zombies have. Why are the zombies violent (if they are)?
	-? parasite. Zombies need to consume human meat to feed the host and spread parasite babies
		- mc has a parasite lodged in their arm
	-? airborne virus that makes people super violent
		- mc and pager kid have to wear gas masks
	- the affliction mutates unpredictably when victim has existing health issue (e.g. a burn victim becomes a flame zombie) --> boss zombies are just zombies with mutations
		- mc had a tumor that prevented the virus from taking full effect -> still sane, but with sick zombie powers
			- mc had brain tumor that prevented affliction from latching on?

- how do you kill zombies


- some rooms are dark, mc has to navigate room in pitch-black darkness
- is sound going to be a factor
	- if player makes too much sound, more zombies come rushing

- zombie arms
	-? Strong arm: press L mouse to swipe at zombies and R mouse to grab a zombie and crush their neck. You can use the grab function to push objects, maybe in front of doors
		- items can't be rotated -> weird mechanic. Not very elegant in 2d
	-? paint arm
	-? flame arm. Allows mc to actually kill zombies. Also use as torch in Wumpus room or rooms without electricity

- hospital design
	-? player can see into adjacent room?
	-? most doors have been broken down? or are zombies compartmentalized bc they're trapped



STORY IDEAS -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- introduction: 
	- option: player goes to hospital to get a brain scan. 
		- mc's doctor is the first zombie player encounters (creating moral tension -> develop later)
		- mc is forced to beat zombie down, cut off arm, and sew it on, otherwise they can't escape the room
			- maybe they need to use the strong arm to move wreckage near an exit door
	- option: pager kid tells mc that they were in a coma (but somehow the virus woke mc up)

- what's the pager kid's deal:	
	- why are they at the hospital

- how did the outbreak happen
